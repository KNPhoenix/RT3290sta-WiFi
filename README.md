# RT3290sta WiFi driver for Linux based OS's #



### What is this repository for? ###

* A mirror of a patched version of the driver
* An easy way to get the WiFi driver
* It's fun ;P

### How do I get set up? ###

* Make sure you have ``` DKMS ``` installed. (It's a dkms-based package)
* Make sure you have the proper ``` linux-headers ``` package installed for your distro (```dkms``` usually requires this)

### What now? ###

To install the driver just
run ```sh install.sh ``` in an elevated prompt (via sudo or su), and
the script SHOULD hopefully take care of everything.

### Who do I talk to if I run into issues? ###
* WiggyWunka (Repo Admin)
